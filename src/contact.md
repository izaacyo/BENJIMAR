Testimonials

Hear what our customers have to say!

Aleksandra - "This box is beautiful. You could use it for keepsakes or to hold remotes or something on an
ottoman; I used it as a gift box for a smaller gift and my sister-in-law loved it!"

Tuomas - "I bought one of these about a week ago and I ended up buying a second one after my intended
purpose could not be met with just one. I like to keep the letters and cards I receive from my
family and friends and previously they were just sort of taking up a bottom of a drawer."
